Campaign Description

Verkon - Drake Warden

01 The Hunt - (Use The Hunt map)
"My name is Reshan'lo, and I was in my youth long ago the Recorder of the Flight of Kerath. It falls to me to report what came to pass in the 14th cycle of the 5th Vulcaniad - the greatest error of Kerath, the flight's downfall and with it my own."

"For long cycles we Recorders of Morogor had watched the slow rising of the tides and the sinking of our islands. Each cycle it became slightly more difficult to feed our hatchlings. Newer flights scraped out a meager existence on islets of rock their grandsires would have scorned, and some turned their eyes enviously on the green expanses of the central islands. We feared a final war was nearly upon us."

"Then the long pig ships came to our northern island. Their forces established a base, and sailed further east. After watching many more ships pass, our people became convinced that there must be more land to be claimed. But none of the existing flights wished to chance leaving the islands of Morogor."

"There arose in the Flight of Verkon a young drake of subtle and dangerous mind who dreamed of those lands far over the waters of the Great Ocean, and spoke of his dream.

Vank: "Galun, I think I spy runners. Away north, past the slave farms."

02 North Morogor - (Use Peoples in Decline map from TRoW with sides remapped)
Having shown promise in the hunt, Verkon speaks with Galun
informs Galun that his sky drakes spying on Norther Morogor have discovered that the leaders of the dirty long-pigs know
where the ships are going to and from. and that they have become careless.
Lead a force of drakes to capture the leaders. The honor from such an accomplishment will give Galun a shot at being chosen for the coming contention
with the raid on the dirty long-pig foothold on northern Morogor

Vank: There they are. Filthy creatures. But meat none the less.
Galun: Indeed. Let's make sure we hold off on eating the leaders until we get the information we need.

On victory: 
Galun's defeat of the foul long-pigs and obtaining of the information of how to find other land earns him much renown.

The drakes don't try flying west, as that path has no stopping points, and that the green isle is overrun with the dirty long-pigs

On victory
Vank: This could make a decent home for the flight.
Galun: Maybe, but we can see the vast mainland from here. Let us scout above and see if there is somewhere better that we might go.



07 Elensefar - (Use map from Liberty, but make it look like a village)
Galun sent the remaining representatives of the other flights back to report on the success of finding the Great Continent.

From above the three sisters, the keenest eyes in the flight
could see a hint of a great range of mountains to the east and north
over the water, such country as we Drakes love to build our eyries in.

With the mainland near, shorter jumps could be made.
With the fire from the volcanoes the drakes reforged their heavier tools and armor for the clashers to prepare for the journey

When everyone was ready, Galun ordered the flight toward the mountains.
On their way, a settlement was spotted.


Vank: A small village of long pigs is ahead.
Galun: Call the hunt!
Hunt and terrorize the village of Elensefar
comment about difficulty of fighting talking-meat in this land.

On Victory
Galun: That was easy/difficult. They were not like the runners back in Morogor. if there were more of them, they would have posed a real threat to the hunt.


08 Kindling - (use kindling map)


Days of flight later they reached the Great Continent and found
themselves over green forest country.

Vank: There is game in those trees. This may be a good place to hunt.

Galun: Yes.  And the flight needs a night onm the ground to rest its
wings.

Vank: Some of the game has two legs rather than four. They don't quite
look like our Runners, though.  They move better.  And...Galun, I
could swear some of the trees down there are <i>moving</i>!

Galun: I see them.  Well, if they choose to fight us, breath-fire
should burn them nicely.  Call the hunt!

Battle ensues. The map should be a fairly dense section of the Forest
of Wesmere. The enemy side(s) should be elves and woses, allied.

On victory:

Galun: That was brisk.

Vank: Yes, and there are more of the two-leggeds heading at us from 
every direction.  I think I'm undercounting them - they're cursed hard
to spot in these woods.

Galun: Set up a rotating overwatch. We'll feed and rest here until the
overwatch flyers spot more of them within a half-league, then fly
north.

Vank: As you command!


09 The Storm
Make a foothills type feel of a map with some caves for a lich & spiders to come out of

As the flight was nearing the range that men would someday call the
Heart Mountains, a fierce storm forced the flight to ground in the foothills
dialog with undead, evil lich, and giant spiders
The Drakes are grounded, so their terrain costs are a Clasher's.

Vank: And us grounded until the storm lifts...

Galun: Maybe you need to start thinking more like a Clasher, Vank.

Battle ensues against one or more troll sides. The Drakes are
grounded, so their terrain costs are a Clasher's.

On victory
Galun: The creatures on the continent are well armed, but we have succeded. Onward


10 Heart Mountains - (Have 10-12 be different sections of a larger map for the surrounding area)
Map needs some lava or a volcano for fire for tools

The flight reaches the spot Galun wants to explore

Vank: What are those shambling things over there?  They look like
Runners, but much bigger and uglier.

Galun: They're waving clubs and they don't look friendly. 


On victory:

Galun: We can beat them, and we can eat them. And I like the feel of 
these mountains.  I think we've found a good place to build an eyrie.

Vank: Excellent. The flight will rejoice.  But it's colder here than
Morogor was.  We'll sleep more.

Galun: That's no bad thing, Vank.  With no rival eyries it's best
that we increase slowly, and draw on the game as lightly as we can.


Vank: What about slave pens?
Galun: I've been thinking about that. I don't want slaves, I never liked the effect keeping them had on us.
Besides, we are not on an island, they could escape more easily.

11 Fire Meets Steel


The Drakes began to carve out a new home with fire and tools.  They
built watchposts, and chambers for the breeders, and sleeping quarters.
They hunted the trolls and the beasts of the mountains for meat.

But this harsh country, too, had its inhabitants.  And one day
they came calling.

Thurdakor: Who dares work stone in these mountains wi'out the
leave o' the Dwarves?

Galun: I am Galun, and this is my Flight.  Who gives us
challenge in the tongue of slaves?

Thurdakor: I am Thurdakor of Knalga, and nae slave but a lord of
the living stone. You squat on my surface land.

Vank (whispering): Galun, their weapons look well-made, and we are few.

Galun: Surface land, eh?  Well, here we shall remain. Perhaps
if you keep to your holes we'll have no trouble.

Vank (whispering): Perhaps that could have been put better...

Thurdakor: Keep to our holes? Arrogant one, you shall learn
the bite of Dwarf steel for that taunt.

Battle ensues.  The dwarven side(s) will have gryphon riders.

(move this to end of 10?)
could have the saurians arrive beginning of scenario (turn 2), they saw the drakes flying above
finally caught up to them. They've been lost & wandering since a long pig had defeated the dragon they
were worshiping


On victory:

Vank: Those "Dwarves" fought well.  If there are many more of them in these
mountains I fear for our hatchlings.  

Galun: We'll flee no further. This is a strong, defensible site and
the range around it is full of game.  If the dwarves molest us,
we'll blood our young warriors on them.

Vank: As you command!
